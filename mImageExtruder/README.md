# Houdini.mTools.mImageExtruder
**All sorts of extrusions from maps. Supports Color, Extrusion and Scatter maps, in File and in COP mode.**

There's 3 mode you can use: Plane, Box and Triangles. With the last mode Scatter options are made available. With the first two you can change the resolution to change the size and quantity of the boxes/plane grids. COPs (could be animated of course) can be made available to the asset to work based on those.

Can produce wireframes based on edges and also there's a "post" step where VDB operations is applied to the model.
