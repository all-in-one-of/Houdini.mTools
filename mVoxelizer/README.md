# mVoxelizer
**The asset makes a voxel representation of the input geo**

You can output different phases of the process to check for changes and there's a second output that contains the point data stream. It accepts custom voxel geometry and you have access to voxel pre-transform and also there's a vex field if you want to further manipulate the pre-voxelization points. There are also transform options to center, resize and place the model on ground. I also put a feature to remove the interior of the result to make it lighter.
